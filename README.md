Makers Academy: Week 4 Challenge
================================

Rewriting the inject method and creating a takeaway programme
-------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1:
Rewrite the inject method and TDD it. 

Level 2:
Write a Takeaway programme with the following functionality: 
1. List of dishes with prices
2. Placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. 
3. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
4. The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API.
5. Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
