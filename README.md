Makers Academy: Week 4 Challenge
================================

Objectives:
-----------
1. To rewrite the inject method and TDD it
2. Write a takeway programme for the terminal

Requirements:
-------------
* TDD
* The takeaway programme should have a list of dishes with prices
* A customer can place an order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities, and a number that should be the exact total. 
* If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API.
* Use a Gemfile to manage your gems


Technical configuration:
------------------------
* Ruby
* RSpec
* Twilio API

Next steps:
-----------
* Can currently only interact with it from the command line
* Next step is to deploy to the web using Sinatra
